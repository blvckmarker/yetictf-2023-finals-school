First of all, welcome aboard, engineer!

What can i say about factory? Well...

It is used to control combined heat and power plant, specifically boiler. It is setting a temperature to a smart controller, programmed to make requested stable temperature. 

In case of malfunctions, contact the engineer @RegularITCat
